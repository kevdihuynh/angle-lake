                  <p>The covenants and restrictions governing the beach lot are legally binding and enforceable. These rules are designed to maintain property values, ensure safety, and provide a pleasant environment for all residents.</p>
                  <p>Public access to the beach lot is strictly prohibited. The facility is maintained through member dues and is intended solely for the use and enjoyment of current members in good standing.</p>
